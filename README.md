# YAGPDB-CCs
A collection of YAGPDB Custom Commands. 

###What's a CC?

It's a Custom Command you can make in YAGPDB.

###Do all of these CC's have a video for them?

Simply yes, however, I will sometimes add to this repository first before making a video, but I will make sure to have some sort of video for the CC's that are here.

##Notice

Please note, that these CC's are not all if not at all my own creation, some are straight from what I have found out there on the web, searched up, tested, and decided to share it out there.
I try my bed to keep some form of copyright/author credit and notes on CC's where I possibly can for clear recognization of where the work came from.
